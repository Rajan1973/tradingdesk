# Quant Terminal

A free trading terminal that runs on your own computer: charts, 87 indicators, 13 drawing tools, alerts, a screener, a heatmap, seasonals, earnings and dividend calendars, news, company financials, a strategy tester with quant checks, bar replay and paper trading. No account, no subscription, no ads, no limit on indicators per chart.

It's one small Node.js app with no dependencies. Your watchlists, drawings, alerts and paper account are plain files in the `data` folder, on your machine.

## Install

**With an AI coding agent (easiest).** Paste the setup prompt into Claude Code or Codex. It checks your machine, installs this, tests it, opens it in your browser and sets up your watchlist. It takes a couple of minutes.

**By hand.**

1. Install Node.js 18 or newer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org) (the LTS version is fine).
2. Get the code: `git clone https://github.com/LewisWJackson/quant-terminal.git`, or download the ZIP from GitHub and unzip it.
3. In that folder, run:

```bash
npm run doctor
```

```bash
npm start
```

There's no `npm install` step. Next time, double-click `start.command` (Mac), `start.bat` (Windows) or run `./start.sh` (Linux).

## Where the data comes from

All free and public, with automatic fallbacks:

| Market | Sources | Limits |
|---|---|---|
| Crypto | Binance, then Binance's market-data mirror, Binance.US, Coinbase, Kraken | Live. If Binance is blocked where you are, Coinbase and Kraken take over |
| US stocks, ETFs, NDX | Yahoo when reachable, Nasdaq's public API | About 10 years of daily history. Intraday history is today's session only unless Yahoo is reachable |
| Forex | Yahoo, then Kraken | Kraken gives the last 720 bars per timeframe |
| CME futures: NQ, MNQ, ES, MES | Yahoo's continuous front month (type `NQ`, `MNQ`, `MES` or `ES1!`) | About 10 minutes delayed, and the chart says so. Live with your own Polygon futures key (below) |
| Indices, other futures, non-US stocks | Yahoo (type `YAHOO:^FTSE`, `YAHOO:GC=F`, `YAHOO:VOD.L`) | Only when Yahoo isn't rate limiting your connection |
| Economic calendar | Forex Factory's weekly feed | This week only |

`npm run doctor` tells you which sources work from your connection.

## Your own data feed (optional)

The public sources need no account. If you have a market data key, add it and charts use it first. When your key can't load a chart, the public sources carry it and the chart says why. Every chart's legend names the source it's on.

| Provider | Covers | What it costs |
|---|---|---|
| Alpaca | US stocks and ETFs, any timeframe | A free account at alpaca.markets gives live prices on the IEX feed. Alpaca's paid plan adds the full market feed (`"feed": "sip"`) |
| Polygon (now called Massive) | US stocks, any timeframe | The free plan is end-of-day only, 5 requests a minute. Paid plans are 15-minute delayed or live |
| Polygon futures | NQ, MNQ, ES and MES, 1m to 1D | A Polygon futures plan; the Advanced plan is live. Charts the front contract (NQZ6 and so on), which moves to the next one 8 days before expiry |

Put your keys in `data/feeds.json` (make the file with any text editor, and leave out the provider you don't use):

```json
{
  "alpaca": { "keyId": "PK...", "secretKey": "...", "feed": "iex" },
  "polygon": { "apiKey": "..." }
}
```

For Alpaca, sign up at alpaca.markets and generate an API key pair in your dashboard (a paper trading account's keys read market data too). Quant Terminal only reads prices with it.

The file stays on your computer. The data folder isn't in git, updates leave it alone, and each key goes only to its own provider, in a request header. A change to the file applies on the next chart load. `npm run doctor` checks each key you added.

## Your own data files

The strategy tester's **Your own data** row imports two kinds of CSV, kept in `data/imports/` on your computer.

- **Bars.** Columns `time, open, high, low, close, volume`, one symbol per file. An Alpaca export (`symbol, timestamp, open, ...`), a TradingView export and MetaTrader's separate date and time columns all read as they are. Times can be ISO (`2026-10-14T14:30:00Z`), `2026-10-14 14:30:00` (read as UTC) or Unix seconds. The file charts as `CSV:NAME` on its own timeframe and any longer one, built from its bars (1-minute bars give 5m, 1h, 1D and the rest), and backtests like any other symbol. Charts and tests use the most recent 20,000 bars at the timeframe you pick.
- **Signal.** Columns `time, position`, where position is `1` (long), `0` (flat) or `-1` (short), or the words long, short and flat. Each row is the position to hold from that bar's close; it fills at the next bar's open, like every signal in the tester. The file becomes an indicator (`custom/signal-<name>.js`) and loads into the tester as rules, so **Run on chart** and **Run quant checks** test your strategy exactly as your own code decided it. Open the bars the signal was made on first.

With no settings to vary, a signal gets the deflated Sharpe, cost stress and Monte Carlo checks; walk-forward, overfitting and nearby settings need a setting like an indicator's length. `POST /api/import/bars?name=NAME` and `POST /api/import/signal?name=NAME` take the CSV as the request body, for scripts (see [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md)).

## Your own indicators

Each custom indicator is a JavaScript file in `custom/`, in one standard format: [`docs/custom-indicators.md`](docs/custom-indicators.md) sets out the inputs, outputs, plotting and how to add one, and [`docs/indicator-template.js`](docs/indicator-template.js) is a file to start from. Every indicator is checked against the format before it loads, and a file that doesn't fit is refused with each problem named. This one is included as an example:

```js
export default {
  name: 'EMA ribbon squeeze',
  overlay: true,
  inputs: [{ key: 'fast', label: 'Fast EMA', type: 'int', default: 8 }, { key: 'slow', label: 'Slow EMA', type: 'int', default: 34 }],
  outputs: [{ key: 'fast', label: 'Fast', kind: 'line', color: '#26a69a' }, { key: 'slow', label: 'Slow', kind: 'line', color: '#ef5350' }],
  calc(bars, p, ta) {
    const close = ta.source(bars, 'close');
    return { fast: ta.ema(close, p.fast), slow: ta.ema(close, p.slow) };
  },
};
```

`ta` has `sma, ema, rma, wma, hma, rsi, atr, stdev, highest, lowest, crossover, crossunder, source` and `compute(id, bars, params)` for any built-in indicator. Return `markers` to put arrows or labels on the chart.

## Strategy format

The tester, alerts and screener share one rule format, so an AI agent can write strategies for you:

```json
{
  "indicators": { "fast": { "id": "ema", "params": { "length": 9 } }, "slow": { "id": "ema", "params": { "length": 21 } } },
  "entryLong": [{ "left": "fast", "op": "crossesAbove", "right": "slow" }],
  "exitLong": [{ "left": "fast", "op": "crossesBelow", "right": "slow" }],
  "stopLossPct": 5, "feePct": 0.1, "slippagePct": 0.05
}
```

Entry conditions must all be true. Exits need all of theirs too, unless you set `"exitMatch": "any"` to exit on whichever one fires first. `"maxBarsInTrade": 10` closes a trade after 10 bars if nothing else has.

`"spreadPct"` is the bid to ask spread: buys fill at the ask, sells at the bid, and stops trigger on that side (the tester's Live spread button reads it from Binance, Coinbase or Kraken). `"intrabar"` sets how stops and targets fill inside a bar: `"worst"` (stop first when a bar touches both, the default), `"ohlc"` (TradingView's path: open, the nearer of high and low, the other, close) or `"magnifier"` (the real lower-timeframe bars inside each bar, like TradingView's bar magnifier).

Operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `crossesAbove`, `crossesBelow`, `crosses`. Operands: a number, a price field (`close`, `high`, `hl2`...), an indicator key, or `key.output` such as `macd.signal`. Signals use a bar's close and fill at the next bar's open.

A backtest shows how rules did on past prices. It doesn't tell you whether the result was luck.

## Drive it from your own code

Everything in the app runs through a local HTTP API on your computer, so your own scripts can use it: bars and quotes, backtests with the quant checks (`POST /api/backtest`), alerts with webhooks, and a live stream of alerts as they fire. [`docs/api.md`](docs/api.md) lists every request. `examples/` has working Python and Rust programs, with nothing extra to install:

```bash
python3 examples/python/quant_terminal.py
cd examples/rust && cargo run --release
```

Add `--listen` to either one to print alerts as they fire.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm start` | Start and open your browser (http://localhost:3777, or the next free port) |
| `npm run serve` | Start without opening a browser |
| `npm run doctor` | Check Node and which data sources you can reach |
| `npm test` | Offline tests (indicators, backtester, server) |
| `npm run smoke` | Start the server and check it serves live data |
| `npm run compare -- BTCUSDT 1D 2026-10-10` | Print indicator values for one bar, to check against another charting tool |

`PORT=4000 npm start` picks a port. `HOST=0.0.0.0 npm start` lets a phone on your home network open it (only do that on a network you trust).

## Limits

- It runs on your computer. Close the laptop and alerts stop.
- No broker connection. Paper trading only, on purpose.
- Free data: crypto is strong, US stocks are daily-first, and non-US markets depend on Yahoo.
- No social feed, no mobile app, no cloud sync.
